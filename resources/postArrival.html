                      After you've savored every moment of your red-carpet
                      welcome (not really, but we do get you home safe &
                      sound!), and after you've got over your initial
                      homesickness, you need to think about starting you school
                      life here. Some tips that'll help you through your first
                      few months at UTD.

                    <p>
                      As soon as you reach, it is best you call home and let
                      your parents know of your safe arrival. Ask a senior or
                      the person coming to pick you up and they will advice you
                      on how to call.

                      get through your first few months in UTD is having good
                      company and good friends. Seniors here are extremely
                      helpful, so try your best to get to know them!!

                      Most of the Indian students will end up staying on campus
                      in either waterview apartments or in university village.
                      These apartments are in great demand and hence you need to
                      book one as soon as possible. With the large number of
                      students coming every semester it might be difficult for
                      all of you to get an apartment on campus. However in case
                      you applied for one really early you should be able to get
                      one. In case you don't then you probably would have to
                      move to an apartment off campus. There are few good
                      apartments close by where you could stay. You do have a
                      UTD shuttle service operating and in case you do not fall
                      in its route you could always use the Dallas Area Rapid
                      Transit - DART (transportation system). In case you stay
                      in apartment close by, you could probably get yourself a
                      bike to commute to and from the university too. Do check
                      out the housing section for more information on the
                      options available.

                    <u> Groceries + Desi Joints</u>
                    <p>
                      An integral part of our lives out here is doing grocery
                      shopping! There are some local grocery stores like Target,
                      Tom Thumb which are real close by. We can easily reach to
                      these places by bus. You can also request one of seniors
                      to give you a ride, since everyone needs to go there
                      anyway. There are some great Indian grocery stores as well
                      where you can find each and every kind of Indian readymade
                      masala (like Parampara or Badshah masala). You can get
                      some Indian homemade spices if you wish and other spices
                      (like cloves, chili powder, etc.) (But these are a little
                      far and your visits to these places will be less frequent)
                      Even these are readily available in the Indian store; you
                      might want to get something if you wish, so that you don't
                      have to go to the Indian store as soon as your apartment
                      is set up. The bottom-line is groceries are not a problem
                      at all, and you can get everything out here real easy.
                      You'll be amazed on seeing the quality of vegetables etc.
                      and more so by seeing their size!!! For the true lovers of
                      India food, there are many Indian restaurants close to the
                      campus, a few of which are within walking distance. There
                      are numerous fast food joints, sandwich places, pizza
                      hangouts close to school. Also, you do not need to get
                      stock of dal/rice from India which would last you for a
                      week. The seniors with whom you will be staying with will
                      have these. Unless you plan on moving in immediately into
                      your new apartment, you are pretty much fine not bringing
                      such stuff.

                      It is best you open your bank account as soon as possible.
                      There are a number of banks located close to the campus, a
                      few being,BB&T and Bank of America. Once you reach UTD,
                      seniors here will be able to give you more information on
                      the bank accounts and the different banks. Opening a bank
                      account here is pretty simple and normally takes around 30
                      to 45 minutes.

                      <b><u>Orientation:</u></b> Attend the orientation. It
                      really does help. Not only do you get a lot of info but
                      you meet others who are in the same boat which makes life
                      easy, since it is always better to do things together;
                      that way you are sure that you have not missed anything.
                      You will also get some stuff such as the school map, which
                      will be your savior for the first few weeks when you start
                      hunting around for your classes, and some other info that
                      you'll need to know as an international student.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b><u>Social Security Number & Texas ID:</u></b> At the
                      orientation, they will tell you about trips to the public
                      safety office to get your social security card as well as
                      the Texas ID. Just tag along with these groups and your
                      work will be done easily. Note that social security
                      numbers are issued only to students having an on-campus
                      job.

                    <p>
                      <b><u>Registration:</u></b> You need to register for 3
                      courses (some brave ones register for 4), but 3 is a must
                      for graduate programs. Check your admission letter to see
                      if you have a conditional admit and whether you have to
                      take any pre-requisite courses. If you have done these
                      courses during undergrad, you can waive off these
                      pre-requisites with the approval of a graduate advisor.
                      During registration, you will be allotted a graduate
                      advisor, who will be able to help you or at least guide
                      you to the right person. Seniors are a big help when it
                      comes to choosing courses. They'll tell you which courses
                      are programming intensive and so on. This will help you
                      decide the course combination that you will be able to
                      handle during the semester. Just ask questions; you'll
                      find most people to be genuinely happy to help you in any
                      way they can.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b><u>RA/TA:</u></b> If you have an RA, go meet your
                      professor!! He/she will help you get the formalities done
                      quickly. Attend the TA/RA orientation program. During this
                      orientation you will be made to fill out various forms,
                      such as your TA/RA agreement, health insurance coverage
                      etc.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b><u>Non RA/TA:</u></b
                      >It is a good idea to start approaching profs asking them
                      to help you choose courses for the semester. You can also
                      ask them whether they could consider your application for
                      assistantship. They will not commit immediately but they
                      may suggest that you take specific courses. Your good
                      performance in these courses in the first semester might
                      land you an assistantship in the second semester. You
                      should also try for on-campus employment. For this you
                      will have to fill out an employment form at the human
                      resources office. Prepare a work resume (1 page
                      preferably). Also visit the cafeteria, book-store and
                      other places where there is a good possibility of getting
                      a part-time job (your seniors will be able to guide you in
                      this regard, once you are here).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b><u>Holds:</u></b> Before registering you will have to
                      clear a number of holds. You will not be allowed to
                      register until all holds are cleared. Clearing these holds
                      as soon as possible is imperative since otherwise, you
                      might miss out on a popular course. Some common holds are:
                      <br />
                      1) Official transcripts not submitted <br />
                      2) Health insurance hold- TB test not submitted
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      You'll have to do a little bit of running around, but
                      it'll get done. Find out what your holds are and get them
                      cleared as soon as possible. This will save you a lot of
                      trouble during registration. The best place to inquire
                      about your holds is the Records office, in the basement of
                      the library building. Once your holds are cleared and you
                      have registered for your courses, you are all set for the
                      grind during the semester. We are all looking forward to
                      meeting you. Come join our student family!

                      accepted. There are deadlines for submitting transfers and
                      waivers and no applications will be accepted after the
                      deadline. <br />• Choose an equivalent UTD course. <br />•
                      Arrange for supporting documentation to be sent or supply
                      it with the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You must apply for all waivers and/or transfers in your
                      first or second semester here. Applications aren’t
                      considered after that.
