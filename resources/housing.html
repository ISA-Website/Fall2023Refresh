                      Students have the option of either staying on-campus or
                      off-campus in apartments located close to the university.
                      Most of the new students arriving here from India stay in
                      apartments on the school campus while a few who donâ€™t
                      manage to get accommodated on-campus go for apartments
                      located close by.

                      There are some apartments located close to the university,
                      we have listed a few of them below. you can also check our
                      websites like www.apartmentratings.com for a more refined
                      search based on your requirements. Please note we do not
                      have complete and up-to-date information such as the rent
                      for some of the apartments so if you are interested in any
                      particular apartment then the best way to find out more
                      information would be to call them up.
                      <br /><br />
                      Please note that in all cases you will also need about
                      $200 for other initial expenses. This is because the
                      apartments are unfurnished and you will have to buy some
                      basic stuff for the apartment. The apartments comes with a
                      gas-range, dish-washer, refrigerator, air
                      conditioner/heater, hot water; some apartments have a
                      washer-dryer.
                      <br /><br />
                      Please note that with the huge number of students coming
                      for fall it might be difficult for everyone to get an
                      apartment on-campus. Under such circumstances the best
                      option would be to move into apartments located close by.
