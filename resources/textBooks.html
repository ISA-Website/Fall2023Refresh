                      Text books are very expensive here, so try to get all the
                      text books that you need from India. Below is a list of
                      textbooks that you might need in the course of your
                      studies. These books are for specific courses, and you
                      might want to get some advice from a student in your field
                      about these. In some cases, we have included books for
                      electives, which you may not ever take. So, you might save
                      money and space by not getting books for those courses
                      which you might never take. Also note that this list has
                      been compiled by students who have taken the courses and
                      there is a possibility that the books used for a
                      particular course might vary based on the professor who is
                      teaching the course.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <u>NOTE:</u> Since the number of courses you would have to
                      take for completion of your degree is more than the text
                      books listed here, it is obvious that you would be taking
                      some courses from other programs, or courses which are not
                      offered every semester, but just once a year or once in 2
                      years. These courses typically are taught by different
                      teachers every time, and the texts that they use are
                      different. But most of you will be taking the courses (the
                      books of which are) listed here.
