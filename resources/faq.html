                This attempts to address questions that you might have about
                UTD, preparing to come to UTD, the student life here, and other
                stuff. Most of it might be of use to you, if you already have a
                admission to UTD, and are planning to come here.

                        airport?</b
                      ><br />
                      A. Yes. The ISA does help provide transportation from the
                      airport and from other places such as bus stations, train
                      stations etc. An ISA volunteer would be present at that
                      place to receive you and get you to the university. Please
                      note that you would have to inform the ISA well in advance
                      by filling a request for pickup – the link to which will
                      be activated on the ISA website about a month prior to the
                      start of the semester.

                        >Q. Should I contact ISA before I book my tickets? Is
                        there any restriction on when I should reach Dallas?</b
                      ><br />
                      A. You do not have to contact us before buying your
                      tickets. You can reach Dallas on anyway, and at any time,
                      and we will try our best to receive you ! But the ISA is
                      an entirely volunteer organization, and the most of the
                      volunteers are students who don't have cars. So, they,
                      typically, have to request other working-students, friends
                      etc. to help them with a ride to the airport. This means,
                      that at times, it might happen that a new students coming
                      at a really weird time and day might not be received at
                      the airport ! The chances of this happening are rare, but
                      it can. So, if you can, without sacrificing money, time,
                      etc and without putting yourself in any trouble, try to
                      reach here during a weekend, or the next best a week-day
                      evening. Arranging airport pickups and transportation is
                      easier on weekends so please try to come here on weekends.
                      BUT, remember, if you have informed the ISA of your travel
                      plans, and we have promised to receive you, we will do
                      that.

                      ><br />
                      A. These are the steps that you must follow <br />
                      Fill in an application for pickup on the ISA website (It
                      will be activated around a month before the start of the
                      semester) where you would be required to provide us with
                      the following information-
                      <br />Your Full Name - please specify your last name,
                      since we might require this at times to trace your flight.
                      <br />Your itinerary - airline which will get you to
                      Dallas, flight number, the date and time of your
                      arrival,Terminal number. Also detailed information about
                      your remaining flights. <br />A Recent Snap – Note that
                      the DFW airport has a large number of Indian students
                      coming in to attend universities like UTD,Texas Tech, UTA
                      etc so to help identify you at the airport it would be
                      highly recommended you provide us with a recent snap or
                      atleast a decent description of yourself. <br />IMP Note:
                      please no group requests. Everyone requesting for a pickup
                      should put in a separate request. <br />Confirm your
                      tickets, and send pickup and accommodation request 10-15
                      days before you leave from India. PLEASE do inform us of
                      any changes to your travel plans. There is no way we can
                      get that information without you informing us. In case you
                      miss your flight make sure you call us and let us know so
                      that we don’t end up waiting at the airport.

                      <b>Q. What should I do after reaching Dallas?</b><br />
                      A. Some of you might have to do your customs and
                      immigration check at the DFW (Dallas) airport. For others,
                      this might be done at another airport in US, if you had a
                      connecting flight. This is known as port of entry. After
                      you are done with this, and after you have collected all
                      your bags, stay where you are. We usually find out where
                      you would be collecting your bags, and so will reach that
                      terminal to find you. The Dallas airport is very large,
                      and it would be very difficult to trace you if you wander
                      away to another terminal/gate. So, stay where you are, and
                      someone will come to meet you!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <b>Q. What if I don't see anyone there?</b><br />
                      A. DON'T PANIC! Even though this is a new place for you,
                      and you don't see anyone around you who looks remotely
                      familiar, don't get scared. In about 90% of the times,
                      person who's coming to get you is caught up in traffic.
                      The airport is about 25 miles from the school campus, and
                      frequently, there are traffic jams on the route to the
                      airport, especially on week-days. So, wait for some time,
                      and he/she will be there. If you do get concerned, or if
                      its been quite some time since have been waiting, call the
                      number that you have been given. Each of you who has
                      gotten in touch with us for transportation will be given a
                      contact number to call in case you don't have anyone
                      receive you at the airport. If you don't get a reply at
                      that number, PLEASE leave a voice message for us. This is
                      most important, and this is the cause of most
                      miscommunication !

                        the number many time - what do I do?</b
                      ><br />
                      A. We are, but, humans, and it can sometimes happen that
                      the person sent to receive you got incorrect information,
                      and went at a different time to a different terminal, or
                      has been caught in traffic for a loooong time. If at such
                      times, you feel the need to reach the campus on your own,
                      do so - its very easy.(Please note however that ISA has a
                      100% pickup record – If we have acknowledged to pick you
                      up we will do our best to do just that) One of the best
                      (and most cost effective ways) is to take the discount
                      shuttle . In the terminal where you are, you will see
                      signs for Ground Transportation . Follow those, they will
                      take you to something that looks like a telephone /
                      intercom booth. Look up the code for Discount Shuttle ,and
                      call that number. Tell the person who answers, that you
                      need a discount shuttle for UTD, which is in Richardson
                      city, which is in North Dallas. Also tell him/her the
                      number of the gate and terminal where you are. You might
                      have to wait for sometime. The shuttle will eventually
                      reach you, and take you to the school campus. This is the
                      address that you give him/her -
                      <br />University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) <br />The street

                      <br />Richardson(North Dallas) <br />TX-75080

                    <p>
                      <b>Q. What do I call and leave a message?</b><br />
                      A. The public telephones in Dallas need around 35 cents to
                      make a call. Please keep this change with you. If you
                      don't have the exact change, but have more than that in
                      coins, you can still use the phone, but you won't get the
                      difference between what you put and how much was actually
                      used (35 cents) back ! If you don't have any change, you
                      can buy something - coke, water, coffee, and ask the
                      vendor for change to make the call, OR look for a
                      samaritan to give you change ! Dial the entire 10 digit
                      number that you have been given. Contrary to what you
                      might have heard from your friends in other cities, you
                      cannot reach anyone in Dallas with just the 7 digit
                      number. You have to put the money in BEFORE you place the
                      call. After the call connects, and no one answers, wait
                      for a few rings, before the answering machine or voice
                      mail comes on, and leave a message. In the message, be
                      sure to say your name, the exact place where you are
                      (gate/terminal) and the airline and flight number that you
                      took.

                      <b>Q. You are scaring me !!</b><br />
                      A. Hey - chill! These are instructions that you might not
                      even have to use. For most of you, you will be met by one
                      of us the instant you come out, and will have a
                      comfortable ride to school. These instruction are for
                      those rare cases, which even though very unlikely, can
                      still happen - and it is better to know what to do than
                      just sit and cry ! AND remember, if you are not sure of
                      what to do, ask any policeman, security person, official,
                      or just any person in the airport for instructions on how
                      to use the phone

                      <b>Does UTD have dorm / student housing?</b><br />
                      Yes - UTD does have on-campus housing. These aren't dorms
                      but are like regular apartments with complete kitchen,
                      bedroom, bathroom and hall; they are owned by a private
                      company (Waterview and University Village). They are for
                      UTD students and are located on the school campus. You can
                      get more information at
                      http://www.utdallas.edu/student/slife/housing/index.html.
                      and in the housing section of the ISA website.

                      <b>How much do the apartments cost ?</b><br />
                      University Housing has a variety of apartments depending
                      on how much space/privacy you require, and how much you
                      can spend. The University Housing web site will have this
                      information. Since the price varies and changes without
                      notice, we request you to check the cost on UTD website.
                      <br /><br />
                      Most of the new students arriving here stay in apartments
                      on the school campus. However with the large number of
                      students coming for each semester, there is no guarantee
                      that each and every one gets an apartment on campus. Under
                      such circumstances the best thing would be to move to an
                      apartment off campus and located close to the university.
                      You will also need about $100 for other initial expenses.
                      This is because the the apartments are unfurnished and you
                      will have to buy some basic stuff for the apartment. The
                      apartments come with a gas-range, dish-washer,
                      refrigerator, air conditioner/heater, hot water; some
                      apartments have a washer-dryer

                      website for more information on this. You will find the
                      online applications for applying for housing on the
                      respective housing websites. Usually at the start of
                      semesters, the Waterview apts have a long waiting list of
                      students (numerous undergrads, and a few grads) wanting
                      apartments, and there is all possibility that you end up
                      on the waiting list too so if possible it is always
                      recommended that you apply for an apartment as soon as
                      possible.

                      ><br />
                      Typically, you would come to UTD, meet with the apartment
                      officials, and wait till an apartment becomes empty. More
                      frequently, you would have parts of apartments become
                      vacant, when a few of the residents move out, and you
                      would then move in those apartments. Depending on the
                      availability, it can take anywhere from few days to a
                      month to get an apartment. In case you do not get an
                      apartment on-campus you would have to move to an apartment
                      off-campus.

                      ISA would love to arrange for vacant apartments for
                      temporary stay, but as of now, it's been very difficult to
                      do that. Instead, we would put you up with some other
                      students in their apartments till you get your own. This
                      is a neat arrangement, since this has a number of benefits
                      - you have a lot of (seniors) friends to help you get
                      adjusted to a new place, guide you with school, courses
                      etc., and help you get your own apartment. Most of the
                      times, this is where you will make friends ! But please
                      understand that this is only a temporary arrangement and
                      asking people to bear the additional expenses of 4-5 temps
                      for more than a week or two is not reasonable. You would
                      have to make your own arrangements for housing as soon as
                      possible. Most of the students who came for last fall
                      experienced the same shortage of apartments so they will
                      be able to help you out as to where to stay in case you
                      need to move off-campus. Feel free to ask any of the ISA
                      members/Indians for more information. Also if you have
                      relatives/friends in Dallas, it would be a great help if
                      you could stay with them for a few days. This would in
                      turn help us to provide temporary accommodation to other
                      students who are in much higher need of one

                      A very valid question, one that we ask ourselves and the
                      school frequently. It does sound very easy in theory, but
                      in reality ... its quite a different story. Firstly, UTD
                      is expanding, the number of new students joining UTD every
                      semester is increasing. In a past few semesters, Waterview
                      alleviated this problem temporarily by building new
                      apartments. We don't know what their future plans are, but
                      even if they do build new apartments, the increase in the
                      new student strength could just nullify that. Also, most
                      of the apartments which become vacant are when students
                      leave those apartments after the semester starts. It is
                      very difficult to anticipate that. What this means is that
                      while the ISA is constantly seeking UTD's help is
                      addressing this problem, we do understand their side of
                      the story, and do realize that this is quite a formidable
                      task.

                      <b>Kinda confusing .. so what do I do?</b><br />
                      Nothing, really ! Just inform us when you are arriving,
                      and we'll take care of your temporary housing. If you have
                      friends staying off-campus, close to UTD, try to stay with
                      them for a few days. We will arrange for apartments where
                      you can stay till you get your own. That might mean some
                      adjustments, but you'll find that its a lot of fun too!

                      ><br />
                      It is very difficult for any student to tell about your
                      chances of getting admitted here at UTD. Many factors such
                      as the GRE scores, your academic performances, your
                      statement of purpose, your fields of interest count
                      towards this decision by the department. The best person
                      to check on this would be the department graduate program
                      secretary, or a faculty member. Since they receive
                      thousands of such emails, they may take a long time
                      replying, or may not even reply to a very general email.
                      Financial aid is decided by the department, and professors
                      frequently appoint teaching/research assistants depending
                      on their research and how that matches with your
                      interests. So writing directly to professors does help
                      sometimes. Usually, from our experience at UTD, your test
                      scores don't matter a lot for being considered for a TA/RA
                      - its usually the other factors (again Q1).

                      <b>Will I get financial assistance / aid?</b><br />
                      As we mentioned in the first Q, there is no way anyone can
                      predict your chances of getting aid. The number of
                      international students coming to UTD has increased
                      tremendously in the past few years, and consequently so
                      has the competition for TA/RA and all on-campus jobs.
                      Also, the number of international students coming to UTD
                      has been on an high increase every semester, which
                      translates into an increased competition for a very small
                      number of assistantships. Also, due to the current market
                      scenario, the number of students enrolling for PHD has
                      shot up drastically. So the chances of getting TA/RA are
                      extremely low for MS students, almost non existent. Even
                      getting on-campus jobs is very tough now as there are huge
                      number of applications for even a single opening. We would
                      not advise you to depend on on-campus job for your
                      education at UTD. Please do remember that the situation
                      changes every semester, and it is better to be prepared
                      for the eventuality of having to bear all your expenses
                      after coming here. Though the chances of getting
                      assistance increases with every semester that you stay
                      here, since you get to interact with faculty more, and can
                      demonstrate your abilities with good grades in your
                      courses here, there is no way any student can tell you
                      about your chances of getting financial assistance in UTD,
                      either in the first semester or second. Getting a TA/RA
                      depends on a lot of factor like your grades in your
                      undergrad, courses you had taken. courses you take in your
                      first semester in UTD, your grades in the first semester,
                      the interest that you have shown in research, your abilty
                      to demonstrate your knowledge of the research being
                      conducted etc.

                      Read next answer for the first part - can I .. ?<br />
                      The second - we don't want to scare you guys - we really
                      want to see you here, but we hope that you realize that if
                      you come here without a TA/RA, there is a high probability
                      that you may NOT get any financial assistance for 2-3
                      semesters. Also, when we write that, "your chances of
                      getting aid in the 2nd semester are better" - what we mean
                      is better than your first semester, but that does not mean
                      that everyone would get a TA or a RA in their second
                      semester !<br />
                      so - MOST IMPORTANTLY - don't depend on getting a job/aid
                      in your 1st/2nd or further semesters in UTD. Make sure
                      that you have enough funds to fall back to, in case you
                      are in a spot. Getting on-campus job is also equivalently
                      tough. But even if you get one, then also no job pays
                      enough to cover tuition fees.

                      ><br />
                      Most of the on-campus jobs depend on factors such as
                      availability, duration of the job, and (we hate writing
                      this, but its true) - your luck at being in the right
                      place at the right time ! The procedure that you have to
                      follow for such jobs is to fill out application at a few
                      places in school, but there are no fixed qualifications
                      for these jobs - most of them are jobs which anyone can
                      do, and don't need any special skills. So, sometimes, if
                      you are lucky, you could walk into (for example) the space
                      physics department, where the graduate secretary has just
                      decided on hiring a student as an assistant - she sees
                      you, talks to you, and decides that she doesn't want the
                      hassle of going to the HR office etc., and gives you a job
                      on the spot ! But, at times, you could have filled out
                      applications at all offices, and be waiting at home for a
                      call, which doesn't come for days. We don't want to
                      disappoint you guys, but this is how it works - the school
                      has number of offices, who usually hire students for jobs
                      - its your job to make sure that you have done everything
                      that you could for getting a job.

                      The best way would be to personally approach the people at
                      the offices where they are recruiting students. You would
                      generally need to submit a copy of your resume and might
                      have to fill in an application for the post. In most cases
                      the school officials ask you to apply through the comet
                      careers (online community where you can forward your
                      resume to places having job openings oncampus). However
                      students gain access to the comet careers only after
                      orientation so if you are a new student, in such cases
                      there isn’t much you can do but wait.

                      Unfortunately, school policy forbid us to answer any such
                      questions related to the status of your admission, or visa
                      related. Please check the site for International Students

                      The only test that you have will have to go through is a
                      skin TB test. UTD will test you the day of your
                      international orientation (usually around the 15th of
                      august). If you test positive for this test (a lot of
                      Indians do), you have to get a chest X-ray to prove that
                      you don't have TB. You have to get this done here, it
                      costs around $ 25-$30 for the X-ray. You will be allowed
                      to register after the skin test. If you really do have TB,
                      you will be given treatment for that here. Medical
                      Certificate ( Plus Chest X-Ray in case skin test is
                      positive ) from India can save you these hassles and
                      money. <br />
                      There is no other medical examination here. The TB test is
                      for immigration purposes - registration at school does not
                      need you to 'pass' any medical tests.

                      <b>How are the living conditions in Richardson?</b><br />
                      Richardson is a really nice place to live in. In fact it
                      was recently voted the 16th best place to live in America.
                      There are a lot of Indians staying here and in the
                      neighboring towns of Irving and Plano. The weather varies
                      from very hot in summers to cold in winters. We do have
                      snow fall a few times in the year so it would be better
                      you pack appropriate clothing while coming here.

                        university have?</b
                      ><br />
                      The university has its own activity center which has an
                      indoor gym, indoor basket ball, squash, volleyball,
                      walleyball, racquetball courts and an indoor swimming
                      pool. In addition there are a number of outdoor basketball
                      and tennis courts along with a few football fields. We
                      also have a cricket ground where ISA generally conducts
                      cricket tournaments throughout the year. The university
                      also has a student union center which houses a couple of
                      billiard tables, chess, carom, and billiard tables in
                      addition to a few arcade machines.

                      <b>What do students do for daily lunch and dinner?</b
                      ><br />
                      Usually almost all students cook their own food at home in
                      their apartments (sharing the days of the week they need
                      to cook along with roommates). The university does have a
                      food store called the Comet Cafe on campus in the student
                      union and also a sort of restaurant called the UTD Pub
                      where you could purchase your lunch/dinner though this
                      might turn out to be a bit too expensive.
