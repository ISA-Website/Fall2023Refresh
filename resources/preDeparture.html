                      Once you have finalized on UTD and have gotten your visa
                      the first thing that you will need to do is buy/collect
                      stuff that you will have to carry with you. Following is a
                      list of suggestions regarding things that you might want
                      to get with you. This list is primarily for students
                      coming to UTD. You may decide what to bring from India and
                      what to buy in the US according to your considerations.
                      You can buy almost everything in the US after you get
                      here, but we strongly recommend you to get all the books
                      that you need from India.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      Please make sure that you get only as much as you can
                      carry, and can unpack/re-pack it fast. Also note that the
                      list of items is constructed according to the personal
                      experiences of students who have come here, so it is
                      possible that there are some important items that are
                      missing or are unnecessarily specified here. Please use
                      your personal discretion and in case you feel there is
                      something missing then you can always send us an email
                      (utdisa@gmail.com) and we will try to update it in the
                      list as soon as possible.

                    <p>
                      The dress code on campus is pretty informal and a T-shirt
                      worn with jeans is almost a universal dress for both sexes
                      here. So, bring plenty of them. Formal clothes may come in
                      use occasionally like during presentations, career fairs,
                      interviews etc. You may, of course, want to bring along
                      some Indian clothes (saris, salwaar-kameez, kurtas, etc)
                      with you for those traditional events like Independence
                      Day, Sangam etc.
                      <br /><br />
                      <b>Formals:</b> One suit (Optional), ties (1/2), shirts
                      and trousers (2/3), traditional saris/kurta.
                      <br />
                      <b>Casuals:</b> Jeans (3/4), T-shirts & sweats (6+),
                      cotton shirts (2+), shorts (for outdoor, indoor, sports
                      use) (2/3).
                      <br />
                      Dallas has hot summers (35-40 C) and cold winters (-3 to
                      15 C), so you will need both summer wear as well as winter
                      clothes. Get a good sweater/jacket, a muffler, a scarf and
                      a woolen cap, but you might get a better coat/jacket in
                      the US. It gets pretty cold here in winter so don't forget
                      the warm clothes. An umbrella might be a good idea, since
                      the rain here, though not a lot tends to come without a
                      warning.
                      <br />
                      <b>Footwear:</b> Sneakers, formal shoes (highly
                      recommended as they are pretty costly here), leather
                      chappals/sandals, bathroom slippers, shoe polish,
                      polishing brush.
                      <br />
                      <b>Winter wear:</b> Sweaters (medium quality, at most 2),
                      muffler/ scarf, woolen cap.
                      <br />
                      No matter where you stay, you'll have access to washing
                      and drying facilities. These machines have large
                      capacities, so that it is possible to do 2-3 week's
                      laundry at a time. So plan your wardrobe accordingly.
                      <br />
                      <b>Undergarments & socks:</b> About 12 sets of
                      undergarments and socks, preferably cotton.
                      <br />
                      <b>Miscellaneous:</b> Towel (2+), napkins (1/2), leather
                      belts (2+), handkerchiefs (6+).
                      <br />
                      <b>Linen:</b> Bed sheets (double bed size, 2), pillow
                      covers (big, 2), shawl/light blanket (for spring/summer
                      use).
                      <br />
                      <b>Things you better buy in the US:</b> Winter jacket,
                      winter gloves, caps, wind-cheaters, track-suits, good
                      sweaters (they're cheap), and comforter. <br /><br />
                      <b>NOTE:</b> Indian clothes (particularly cottons) have a
                      tendency to shrink a lot when washed on the hot and/or
                      warm cycle in a washing machine here or by drying them in
                      the dryer, so please be careful with sizes.

                      Food is not a problem for either vegetarians or
                      non-vegetarians, although if you are a non-vegetarian you
                      have more choice. There are lots of eating joints in the
                      vicinity, providing Indian/American/Mexican/Oriental
                      foods. But it would certainly be cheaper and healthier to
                      develop some culinary skills. Come well-armed with your
                      pots and pans & some recipes. Be sure to bring along flat
                      bottomed vessels because you would be using electric
                      stoves here (preferably the ones with copper bottom).
                      <br /><br />
                      <b>Cooking Utensils:</b> Spoons, forks, GOOD knives, cups,
                      glasses (2 each), a melamine (microwaveable) set
                      (Optional) consisting of plates, soup-bowls and regular
                      bowls (2 each), (these are pretty cheap here and are
                      optional) and a good cooking book
                      <br />
                      Although, you can buy almost all kinds of Indian foodstuff
                      here, get a reasonable quantity of the following, enough
                      to last you for your setup period and save you some money
                      initially.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <b>Condiments and spices:</b> Its better not to bring
                      spices as some people have faced problems bringing them in
                      the recent past. You will find almost all the spices here
                      in Dallas, so you don't need to bring them along. You can
                      buy them here.
                      <br />

                      <b>NOTE:</b>DO NOT get any fresh fruits or meat and spices
                      like Jeera. <br />
                      <br />
                      <b>Remember:</b> the easiest way to make new friends, is
                      to feed the existing Indian food-starved populace with
                      desi delicacies and sweets, so if there are any
                      specialties of your place, do get them along.

                      The initial expenses are high. Below is an estimate of how
                      much money you might need. This will vary depending on
                      your course and the apartment.
                      <br /><br />
                      <b>Tuition Fees:</b> The tuition fees for 9 credits hours
                      (3 courses) for the first semester (which is normal for
                      graduate students) is about $6582 (Fall 2008).There are
                      some additional fees like International Student
                      Orientation Fee , International Student Special Services
                      Fee , Health Insurance , Audit Fee , Records Processing
                      Fee and Recreation Center Fee. (The total would come to
                      around $7500 including the health insurance). TA's and
                      RA's pay about $1500 the first semester. This includes the
                      in-state tuition fees and all expenses mentioned above,
                      discounted by a TPEG grant (which is a grant of about $500
                      every semester for TA/RAs). The school covers the medical
                      insurance for TA/RA's. RAs may get paid slightly more than
                      this amount. Also note that the university no longer gives
                      out TAs to masters students The school also lets you pay
                      the fees in three installments over the entire semester or
                      take a short term loan (5% interest) over three months and
                      pay the entire amount at the end of the 3 months. But, we
                      would STRONGLY advise you to bring the entire amount with
                      you at least for the first semester.

                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <b>Living Expenses:</b> Living expenses are generally $300
                      - $400 per month. This includes room rent, groceries,
                      electricity and telephone bills and other miscellaneous
                      expenses (assuming that you are sharing your apartment
                      with fellow students). If you plan on staying individually
                      expenses will be a lot higher than the amount listed
                      above. <br /><br />
                      You can get a check/DD payable to "University of Texas at
                      Dallas" for the exact amount (if you know it), for a
                      slightly smaller amount, and pay the remainder in
                      cash/travelers checks or get a check for a larger amount
                      and the university will refund you with the remaining by
                      writing you a personal check. If you plan on not getting a
                      DD then you could carry the whole amount in travelers
                      checks. Once you reach UTD you can open up your own bank
                      account and deposit the travelers checks and cash. To pay
                      your tuition you could then write the university a
                      personal check. Also remember to keep your
                      money/checks/demand drafts in your cabin luggage which you
                      will be carrying with you always.
                      <br />

                      <b>NOTE:</b>We would advise you to carry your money in the
                      form of Traveler's Checks so that you may en cash them
                      immediately. DDs take about a fortnight to be credited to
                      your account. Also make sure you have some 1 dollar bills,
                      25 cent and 10 cent coins with you (essential in case you
                      need to call us from the airport as miss a connecting
                      flight and arrive late is quite common). <br />
                      <br />
                      *These are just estimates. Although we try to update this
                      page regularly, these may not be most current ones, so
                      PLEASE PLEASE check with the admissions office for the
                      exact fees at tuition Fees Schedule. The information
                      listed here is current as of Fall 08.

                      <b>PRE-REQUISITE COURSES:</b> If you have any
                      pre-requisites and you feel that you do not need to
                      complete them, then please get all the relevant documents
                      (for each pre-requisite you wish to get waived, get

                      documents you feel appropriate) you can to get that
                      pre-requisite waived. Generally, during the middle of the

                      <br />
                      <b>Books and Stationary:</b> Books are very expensive
                      here, so, find out the books that you will need for your
                      course from us and try to get them from India. A single
                      book might cost you more than a month's grocery bill!! You
                      will find a list of the text books that you may need
                      listed department wise on the ISA website books section.

                      <br /><br />
                      <b>Documents:</b>You may want to bring along photocopies
                      of your documents (2-3) as each photocopy costs 6cts, and
                      further more it may help if you want to take transfer to

                      <br />
                      <b>Drivers Licence:</b>It is preferable that you learn
                      driving and come, as eventually sooner or later you will
                      be driving here in the US. If you have a driving license
                      in India or will be getting one before coming here, be
                      sure to get an IDP (International Driving Permit). It is
                      generally valid for 1 year and you can rent a car and
                      drive in the US with it. Once you reach UTD, you can apply
                      for a Texas Driver’s license. <br />

                      you'll soon want to try the 'phirang' stuff, your home kit
                      is good to carry around in travel), trimming scissors. You
                      can buy shampoo, talcum powder etc. later (no need to
                      bring them from India). <br />

                      <b><u>TO DO:</u></b>
                      <br /><br />
                      <b>Driving:</b> Learn driving and get an International
                      Driving Permit (if possible).
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <b>Cooking:</b> You will be staying in an apartment either
                      on-campus or off-campus and would have your own kitchen.
                      If you have never stayed away from home and cooked on your
                      own then you better start brushing up on your culinary
                      skills as soon as possible. Knowing how to cook is
                      indispensable. Eating out is pretty expensive here and you
                      have a limited choice in the menu if you are vegetarian.
                      Cooking is a very important aspect of your life here and
                      if neglected it can create problems with your roommates so
                      make sure you get a few cooking lessons from your mom
                      before you leave home. <br /><br />
                      <b>Medical Check ups:</b>Get your eyes, teeth and body
                      checked up thoroughly and have any issues taken care of
                      before coming here. Medical tests cost a fortune here and
                      even with health insurance you have to pay a lot of money
                      for the most minor doctor visits. Bring along an extra
                      pair of spectacles or contact lenses along with a small
                      medical kit of medicines you generally use in case of a
                      common cold or fever. Also bring your medical history in
                      case of specific ailments. If possible also take your MMR,
                      FLU and Hepatitis shots (optional), shot in India and do
                      not forget to bring along those certificates. Plan even
                      the date of taking the shots well in advance as multiple
                      doses are usually administered with a specific time gap.

                      <b>Apply for an Apartment:</b> Since the housing options
                      and the procedure to apply for an apartment is a pretty
                      big one we have decided to provide a separate section for
                      it. You will find the link to the page here - Housing

                      <b><u>DO NOT </u> </b> <br />
                      <b>Electrical Appliances:</b>The voltage and frequency
                      used here are different (110V/60Hz). And in any case,
                      appliances like iron, toasters etc are very inexpensive
                      and you can purchase them once you are settled in. Some
                      other things that you might be better of buying here are
                      blank notebooks, file folders, hangars, washing soap,
                      knives, large rice cookers (they occupy a lot of space in
                      the luggage and you get really good ones here for around
                      $30). You also need not bring stuff like rice, salt,
                      sugar, electrical iron, audio players etc.
