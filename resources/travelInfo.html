                      If you've got your I-20 & visa, if you are done with
                      shopping, you are all set to fly. Some stuff that will
                      help you, make your travel comfortable and worry-free.

                      <br />
                      The first thing you need is to get an air ticket to
                      Dallas. The Dallas airport is officially known as the
                      Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Airport. This is about 25 miles
                      from the school. Most of the flights from India do not
                      have Dallas as their port of entry. Your port of entry,
                      which is the first airport in the US that you arrive at,
                      is where you will go through customs & immigration. There
                      is an additional domestic airport located in lovefield
                      called the Dallas-Love Field Airport which is located
                      around 20 miles from the university. However since it is a
                      domestic airport and does not have international flights,
                      most Indian students arrive at the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW)
                      airport.

                      <b><u>Tickets:</u></b> Reserve your tickets at the
                      earliest to get one smart deal. It is very difficult to
                      get a cheap ticket at a late date. You should plan with
                      enough time for getting your visa. Plan to arrive in
                      Dallas around 3-7 days before the Orientation Date
                      (mentioned in your school documents). Inform us as soon as
                      your travel plans are made in case you need a pickup at
                      the airport. A weekend would be ideal. Most of the
                      students here do not own cars, and have to plan your
                      airport pick-ups with others who would most probably be
                      working on weekdays. So, try to reach Dallas either in the
                      evenings or on a weekend, but of course, whenever you
                      reach, we'll try our best to receive you at the airport.
                      It will be very convenient if you can plan your journey
                      with friends coming to UTD. It is imperative that we are
                      informed well in advance, of your arrival, to avoid any
                      confusion. Remember, that Dallas is 10 1/2 hours (from
                      April to September, 11 1/2 for the rest of the year)
                      behind Indian time.

                      <b><u>Luggage:</u></b> By now, you must have received tons
                      of advice on what to take with you from all and sundry.
                      This "tons of advice" will normally translate into "tons
                      of luggage" and while you may not be averse to the idea of
                      performing the Herculean task of carrying it around
                      airports of the world, we doubt if your back or the
                      airlines would look kindly on this venture. The bag
                      dimensions, the number of bags and the amount of luggage
                      involved changes based on the flight carrier so check with
                      your travel agent or airline site for that information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b><u>Documents:</u></b> REMEMBER - keep all your
                      immigration-related documents (I-20/IAP-66, passport, visa
                      etc) with you. Do not keep them in the check-in luggage.
                      Keep them either in you hand bag/purse or carry them with
                      you in your hand. Also keep some clothes (for 2/3 days) in
                      it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Sharp and pointed objects like scissors/nail cutters/
                      knifes are to be kept in the check-in baggage and not in
                      the hand/cabin baggage
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b>NOTE:</b> <br />1) You should keep your passport and
                      I-20/IAP-66 with you at all times - do not put any of your
                      immigration papers in your check-in luggage <br />2) There
                      have been cases of students losing their check-in baggage
                      so please make sure that you do not keep your original
                      documents and money in the check-in luggage.

                      <b><u>Immigration:</u></b> You will have to go through
                      customs and immigration at your port of entry. Sometime
                      before the plane lands, the flight attendant will
                      distribute customs declaration forms and immigration
                      forms. Fill these out on the plane. You will submit them
                      to the appropriate US Customs authorities after you land.
                      If you do not understand a form, ask the flight attendant
                      for assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b><u>Customs:</u></b> Even if your luggage is booked
                      through to your final destination, it will be off-loaded
                      at your port of entry. . Just before you land in the port
                      of entry you will be given a form to fill out in the
                      flight, which will reflect your details, country of
                      citizenship, visa status passport number, etc. This
                      document is called the I94 and you can click here to
                      download a sample of the I94 form. After passing through
                      the immigration area, you will collect your baggage and
                      then, with your baggage, pass through customs. A customs
                      inspector will ask you to declare what you have brought
                      into the country. She/He will inspect your bags and review
                      the customs form you have filled out on the airplane.
                      Penalties for concealing declarable items can be severe,
                      so be honest and make a full declaration. As far as
                      edibles go, just remember that there should be no fruits,
                      vegetables or anything raw. Pickles, Spices, etc will be
                      allowed in as long as they are packed properly and sealed.
                      Spices are usually classified as non-perishable and
                      dehydrated and you may declare them as such. You need to
                      be ready with you passport, visa, filled I-94 form and
                      your I-20 while heading to the Immigration check counters.
                      The officer will endorse the I-94 form and staple it to
                      your passport. Make sure you do not lose it.

                      <b><u>Connecting Flights:</u></b> If you will be
                      continuing your journey by air, check in at the
                      appropriate airline counter as soon as you are through
                      customs. In most airports, you might have to change
                      terminals to board your connecting flight. Please ask the
                      airline representative at the counter about changing
                      terminals. You might have to use the Airport Transport
                      System to do so. These counters are right outside the
                      customs area, usually. Remember, it is your responsibility
                      to collect your baggage after passing through immigration,
                      clear it through customs, and get it checked in again for
                      the onward connection. In case your baggage does not
                      arrive on the same flight as you, do not waste too much
                      time hunting for it. Mention it to the airline
                      representative and give them a forwarding address and
                      phone number where you can be reached. In any event, do
                      not miss your connecting flight. In case your flight came
                      in late, or the onward flight is cancelled, it is the
                      responsibility of the airline on which you flew into the
                      country, to make arrangements for another flight and if
                      the delay involves an overnight stay, then the airline has
                      to put you up for the night and also pay for your meals.
                      Do not let the airline representative convince you
                      otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <b><u> NOTE:</u></b> Please don't panic if it so happens
                      that your flight arrives late and the time for the
                      connecting flight is too near (say, within the next 10-15
                      minutes) for you to make it due to Immigration and Customs
                      delays. Simply follow the same actions outlined above and
                      get your airline to arrange things for you. Don't be rude,
                      but be firm while dealing with the airline
                      representatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If a representative from the airline on which you will be
                      traveling is outside the customs area, tell him/her that
                      you are taking the plane to Dallas. (Many times he/she
                      will telephone ahead and the plane will be held for a few
                      minutes for you.)

                    <p>
                      <b><u>IMPORTANT:</u></b>
                      In case you miss your flight and you have requested for an
                      airport pickup it is imperative that you call up the ISA
                      officials and let them know of your modified itinerary.
                      You will find public pay phones throughout the airport and
                      in case the ISA official doesn’t pick up your call you can
                      leave them a message on their voice mail.

                      the airport. There are no payphones outside so do not go
                      around searching for one. You should be able to find one
                      inside near the luggage claim area. If you have
                      communicated your travel plan to us and you find none of
                      us at the airport, wait for at least 45 minutes before
                      trying to find your way to UTD. Remember to call one of us
                      before you do that. A list of numbers is attached below.
                      If you have been given a contact name and a number of the
                      person who would be coming to the airport to receive you,

                      <b><u> Using the phone:</u></b> A phone call requires 50
                      cents so keep some change with you. One dollar notes can
                      be changed in a changing machine. You can also buy a
                      coffee or soft drink with a dollar bill and get change. In
                      case you can't find a payphone or do not have change for
                      one, you could try asking fellow travelers at the airport
                      in case they have a cellphone. Most of them would be
                      willing to help, especially if they know it's your first
                      day in US. A US phone number always consists of 10 digits
                      (123) 456 7890. The first three digits are the area code
                      and the remaining are the telephone number. The area code
                      for some dallas cities are 214;972;469;682 etc Making
                      calls to a local number (i.e to a telephone number with
                      the same area code as that of yours), you do not need to

                      to happen, you will have to talk to the airline officials
                      at the airport. You will be asked to fill a form, do so.
                      You will have to fill in an address on the form - this
                      address will be the place where they will deliver your
                      bags. If you know the exact address where you are going to
                      stay, give that one. If you will be given temporary
                      accommodation after reaching UTD (which would be true for
                      most of you), this is the address that you give

                      <b><u>Bus Shuttle Services:</u></b> If you land at DFW and
                      have not informed us, there is a possibility that you may
                      not be able to contact us and might have to come on your
                      own to the addresses given below. Don't take a taxi as
                      this might turn out to be quite expensive. Go to the
                      courtesy phone in the baggage claim area. Select ground
                      transportation and dial 08 for Discount Shuttle Service
                      (around 30$) and give them your terminal number of arrival
                      and destination (UTD/Waterview Park apts, Richardson in
                      your case), or dial 02 for Super Shuttle Service (around
                      30$). This is the information that you will give them on
                      your destination. Your destination is Waterview
                      Apartments, on the campus of UTD - University of Texas at
                      Dallas. The street address is 2600 Waterview Parkway. This
                      is in a city called Richardson, which is in North Dallas.
                      The closest street intersection is Campbell & Coit Roads.
                      Most of the times, just telling UTD campus will be enough,
                      but Dallas is a large place, and there might be some
                      drivers who might need additional information.
